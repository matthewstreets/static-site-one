# static-site-one

I built this site in a single day as I followed a responsive web design tutorial. 

While it is far from perfect, it serves as an example of where I started in my coding journey.

As I continue to learn more, I may revisit this site to implement additional functionality.

For now, it will remain a simple static webpage constructed with HTML and CSS.
