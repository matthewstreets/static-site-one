        <div class="card">

            <p>Although the United Kingdom is home to many incredible cities, none shines so bright as its capital: London. Located in south-east England, London is the largest city in the country, and it is known for its wide-reaching international influence. As a centre for the arts, fashion, commerce, education, media, and many other industries, the city is truly unparalleled in its stature.</p>
            
            <p>However, the grandiosity of the city's scale and opulence can be overwhelming to those who are visiting for the first time. As such, this brief pocket guide aims to lend a helping hand to those in need of it.</p> 

            <blockquote cite="https://www.samueljohnson.com/tiredlon.html">"<em>Why, Sir, you find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.</em>" - Samuel Johnson</blockquote>

            <h2 class="card-title">Zones 1, 2, and 3 -- Oh, My!</h2>

            <p>One of London's most confusing aspects for newcomers is the sheer scale of the city. Getting from one side of the city to the other can take over an hour in some cases! Thankfully, the city's main transportation provider, Transport for London (TfL), has designed its transportation network in a logical, efficient way.</p>
            
            <p>The city is comprised of concentric travel 'zones', with Zone 1 being the innermost zone and Zone 9 being the outermost zone. The majority of visitors will remain in Zone 1 and Zone 2 for the duration of their stay, and it just so happens that most major attractions are in these areas. <em>Huzzah!</em></p>
            
            <p>Of course, it's worth taking a trip to some outer zones, as there are hidden gems sprinkled throughout the city. ðŸ’Ž</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Losing Pounds is Easy</h2>

            <p>If you're trying to lose a few pounds during your visit, you're in luck. It's incredibly easy to lose tens if not hundreds of pounds in the blink of an eye, because London is very expensive! (Apologies if you thought I was speaking about the other kind of pounds. You'll have to lose those the hard way.)</p>
            
            <p>Restaurants and shops in the tourist areas tend to be quite high, so it's important to plan ahead for meal times, as you'll need to explore a bit to save. Thankfully, there are many truly amazing cuisines from around the world represented in London, all available at a range of price-points.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">The City That (Always) Sleeps</h2>

            <p>There's never any shortage of things to do in London, and there really is something for everyone -- even those who don't want to do a thing. London is a city of neighbourhoods, each with its own energy and pace. Sometimes the buzz of the city centre is exhausting, but thankfully the city provides ample time to recharge. Apart from specific neighbourhoods (I'm looking at you, Soho and Dalston), London calms down in the late evenings and can feel just as quiet as the countryside. It really is the perfect balance.</p>
