        <h1>The London Pocket Guide</h1>

        <p>Although the United Kingdom is home to many incredible cities, none shines so bright as its capital: London. Located in south-east England, London is the largest city in the country, and it is known for its wide-reaching international influence. As a centre for the arts, fashion, commerce, education, media, and many other industries, the city is truly unparalleled in its stature. However, the grandiosity of the city's scale and opulence can be overwhelming to those who are visiting for the first time. As such, this brief pocket guide aims to lend a helping hand to those in need of it.</p>
